### Get started with TDD in Jasmine

First you need to clone this repo to you local machine

```sh
$ git clone git@github.com:abruzzi/tdd-boilerplate.git
```

And then go to the folder `git` created for you:

```sh
$ cd tdd-boilerplate
```

Add your `specification` to `spec` folder and source code to `src` folder. Finally, don't forget to update the references in `SpecRunner.html`.

There are 2 placeholders in the file:

```html
  <!-- include source files here... -->

  <!-- include spec files here... -->
```

One thing should keep in your mind is `source` code should be placed `BEFORE` the `specification` testing against it.

Have fun!
